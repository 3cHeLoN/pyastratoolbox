#-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the Python interface, you need the All Scale Tomographic Reconstruction Antwerp Toolbox:
https://code.google.com/p/astra-toolbox/
Please install the ASTRA toolbox first.

Other requirements: Cython (version >= 0.13), NumPy

Use install.sh to install the Python interface to the ASTRA toolbox.
Only run install.sh as ./install.sh in the base directory of the interface code.
You need write permission to the $PYTHON_PATH directory.
We recommend using a Python virtualenv if root access is impossible.
The Python interface to the ASTRA Toolbox uses Python version 2.

Usage: ./install.sh [-i astra_include_path] [-l astra_library_path] [-p python_executable_path] [-c cuda_path]

	-i astra_include_path:		specify path to astra header files (without trailing astra/) (Optional)
	-l astra_library_path:		specify parent path of astra library file (Optional)
	-p python_executable_path:	specify path to python executable (Optional)
	-c cuda_path:			path to CUDA (Optional)
	-h:				print this help (Optional)

Note that the paths only have to be specified if they are not already in your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etcetera.

When compiling with CUDA, the astra_include_path should be set to the 'include' directory of the ASTRA toolbox
source.
